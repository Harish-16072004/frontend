## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Security Mistakes ❌

```bash
# DON'T commit secrets to Git
git add .env  # ❌ NEVER DO THIS!

# DON'T use weak passwords
JWT_SECRET=123456  # ❌ TOO WEAK!

# DON'T use same password everywhere
# Dev password: dev123
# Prod password: dev123  # ❌ SAME PASSWORD!
```

**DO THIS INSTEAD:** ✅
```bash
# Add .env to .gitignore
echo ".env" >> .gitignore

# Generate strong secrets
openssl rand -hex 32

# Different passwords per environment
# Dev: dev-secret-xyz123
# Prod: prod-8f3b2c1a5d4e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o
```

### 2. Deployment Mistakes ❌

```bash
# DON'T run as root
sudo npm start  # ❌ Security risk!

# DON'T skip backups
# "I'll backup later..."  # ❌ Do it NOW!

# DON'T ignore errors
# "It has one error but works..."  # ❌ Will break in production!
```

**DO THIS INSTEAD:** ✅
```bash
# Use PM2 process manager
pm2 start server.js

# Setup automated backups
crontab -e  # Schedule daily backups

# Fix ALL errors before deploying
npm run test  # Ensure all tests pass
```

### 3. Cost Mistakes ❌

```bash
# DON'T forget to monitor costs
# "Forgot to check bill..."  # ❌ Might get charged!

# DON'T use expensive services on Free Tier
# "Let me try RDS instead of Atlas..."  # ❌ Costs money!

# DON'T leave large instances running
# "Forgot to stop t2.large..."  # ❌ Not free!
```

**DO THIS INSTEAD:** ✅
```bash
# Setup billing alerts
AWS Console → Billing → Budgets → Create budget

# Use free tier services
MongoDB Atlas (free 512MB) instead of AWS RDS

# Use free tier instance
t2.micro (free 750 hours/month)
```
