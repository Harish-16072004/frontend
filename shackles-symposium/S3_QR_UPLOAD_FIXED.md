# ✅ S3 QR Code Upload - FIXED!

## 🐛 Issue Identified

**Problem:** QR codes were not being uploaded to S3 bucket

**Root Cause:** The S3 bucket has ACLs disabled (Access Control Lists Not Supported)

**Error Message:**
```
AccessControlListNotSupported: The bucket does not allow ACLs
```

---

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **Removed ACL from all S3 upload functions**

**File:** `backend/src/utils/s3Upload.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
const params = {
  Bucket: bucket,
  Key: fileName,
  Body: buffer,
  ContentType: contentType,
  ACL: 'public-read'  // ❌ This caused the error
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
const params = {
  Bucket: bucket,
  Key: fileName,
  Body: buffer,
  ContentType: contentType
  // ✅ Removed ACL - bucket uses bucket policy for public access
};
```

#### 2. **Fixed duplicate folder path in QR generator**

**File:** `backend/src/utils/qrGenerator.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
const s3Result = await uploadBufferToS3(
  qrBuffer,
  `qrcodes/${participantId}.png`,  // ❌ Folder added twice
  'image/png',
  'qrcodes'
);
```

**After:**
```javascript
const s3Result = await uploadBufferToS3(
  qrBuffer,
  `${participantId}.png`,  // ✅ Fixed
  'image/png',
  'qrcodes'
);
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### When Admin Verifies Payment:

```
1. Generate Participant ID (SHGN001/SHEN001/SHWK001)
        ↓
2. Generate QR Code Buffer (PNG, 500x500px)
        ↓
3. Upload to S3 (WITHOUT ACL parameter)
        ↓
4. S3 Returns Public URL
   https://shackles-25-26.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/qrcodes/...
        ↓
5. Save URL to MongoDB
        ↓
6. Send Email with QR Code
        ↓
✅ COMPLETE!
```

   - ✅ QR uploaded to S3
   - ✅ URL saved to database
   - ✅ Email sent to user
   - ✅ Response shows QR URL

4. **Verify in S3:**
   - Check AWS S3 Console
   - Navigate to: shackles-25-26 → qrcodes/
   - Should see: `[timestamp]-SHEN001.png`

5. **Check Email:**
   - User receives email with:
     - Participant ID: SHEN001
     - QR code embedded image

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Upload Still Fails:

**Check AWS Credentials:**
```bash
# In .env file:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIASRKXOGS4ALPJTZGG
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[your-secret-key]
AWS_REGION=ap-south-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=shackles-25-26
```

**Test S3 Connection:**
```bash
cd backend
node test-s3-upload.js
```

**Check Backend Logs:**
Look for console output during payment verification:
```
✅ Generated participant ID: SHEN001 for harish...
✅ QR code generated and uploaded to S3: https://...
✅ Payment verified for user: harish...
```
