# ✅ Registration Cancellation Feature Removed

## 🎯 What Was Changed

As per your requirement: **"There is no cancellation of registration from the symposium"**

All cancellation-related code has been removed from the system.

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. **Registration Model** (`backend/src/models/Registration.js`)

#### ❌ Removed Fields:
```javascript
// REMOVED from schema:
cancelledAt: Date,
cancelledBy: ObjectId,
cancellationReason: String
```

#### ✅ Updated Status Enum:
```javascript
// BEFORE:
status: {
  enum: ['pending', 'confirmed', 'cancelled', 'attended']
}

// AFTER:
status: {
  enum: ['pending', 'confirmed', 'attended']
}
// 'cancelled' status removed
```

#### ❌ Removed Methods:
```javascript
// REMOVED:
RegistrationSchema.methods.canCancel = function() { ... }
RegistrationSchema.methods.cancel = function() { ... }
```

---

### 2. **Registration Controller** (`backend/src/controllers/registrationController.js`)

#### ❌ Removed Function:
```javascript
// REMOVED entire function:
exports.cancelRegistration = async (req, res) => { ... }
```

**Impact:**
- Users can no longer cancel their registrations
- Admins cannot cancel registrations

---

### 3. **Registration Routes** (`backend/src/routes/registrationRoutes.js`)

#### ❌ Removed Route:
```javascript
// REMOVED:
router.post('/:id/cancel', cancelRegistration);

// REMOVED from imports:
cancelRegistration
```

**Impact:**
- Endpoint `POST /api/v1/registrations/:id/cancel` no longer exists
- Attempting to cancel will return 404

---

### 4. **Payment Verification Controller** (`backend/src/controllers/paymentVerificationController.js`)

#### ✅ Updated Rejection Behavior:
```javascript
// BEFORE (when rejecting payment):
registration.status = 'cancelled';

// AFTER (when rejecting payment):
registration.status = 'pending';
// Keeps as pending instead of cancelled
```

**Impact:**
- When admin rejects payment verification
- Registration stays as "pending" (not "cancelled")
- User can potentially try again with correct payment proof

---

## 🔒 New Registration Status Flow

### **Old Flow (WITH Cancellation):**
```
pending → confirmed → attended
   ↓
cancelled (user/admin could cancel)
```

### **New Flow (NO Cancellation):**
```
pending → confirmed → attended
(No cancellation option available)
```

## 📊 Registration Statuses Explained

| Status | Description | Can Change To |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **pending** | Registration submitted, awaiting payment verification | confirmed (if approved), pending (if rejected) |
| **confirmed** | Payment verified, registration confirmed | attended (when checked in) |
| **attended** | User checked in at event | _(final state)_ |

---

## 🚫 What Users CANNOT Do Anymore

❌ Cancel their own registrations  
❌ Request cancellation through API  
❌ Get refunds (no cancellation = no refunds)  

---

## ✅ What Users CAN Do

✅ Submit registration with payment proof  
✅ Wait for admin verification  
✅ Receive QR code after approval  
✅ Attend event with QR code  

---

## 👨‍💼 What Admins CAN Do

✅ View pending registrations  
✅ Approve payment verification  
✅ Reject payment verification (keeps as pending, not cancelled)  
✅ Delete registrations (if absolutely necessary)  
✅ View all registrations  
✅ Mark attendance  

---

## 🎯 Business Logic

### **Why Remove Cancellation?**

1. **No Refunds Policy**: Once registered, fees are non-refundable
2. **Seat Management**: Confirmed registrations hold event seats
3. **Planning**: Final headcount needed for arrangements
4. **Commitment**: Participants commit when they register

### **What Happens If User Wants to Cancel?**

Since there's no self-service cancellation:
- User must contact admin directly
- Admin can manually delete registration if policy allows
- Payment is not refunded (per symposium rules)

---

## 🔧 Admin Options for Special Cases

If admin needs to remove a registration (exceptional cases):

### Option 1: Delete Registration
```
DELETE /api/v1/admin/registrations/:id
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>
```

### Option 2: Reject Payment Verification
```
PUT /api/v1/admin/registrations/:id/verify
Body: {
  "action": "reject",
  "rejectionReason": "Policy violation / Duplicate registration / etc."
}
```
*This keeps registration in database as rejected, not cancelled*

---

## 📱 Frontend Impact

### Components to Update:

1. **User Dashboard**
   - ❌ Remove "Cancel Registration" button
   - ❌ Remove cancellation confirmation dialogs

2. **Registration List**
   - ❌ Remove "Cancel" action
   - Update status display (no 'cancelled' status)

3. **Admin Panel**
   - ✅ Keep "Delete" option (admin only)
   - ✅ Keep "Reject Payment" option
   - ❌ Remove "Cancel Registration" option

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Try to Cancel (Should Fail)
```powershell
# This should return 404 (route doesn't exist)
$headers = @{"Authorization" = "Bearer $token"}
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/v1/registrations/$regId/cancel" -Method Post -Headers $headers
```

### Test 2: Check Status Values
```powershell
# Statuses should only be: pending, confirmed, attended
$headers = @{"Authorization" = "Bearer $token"}
$registrations = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/v1/registrations/my-registrations" -Method Get -Headers $headers
$registrations.data | Select-Object registrationNumber, status
```

### Test 3: Reject Payment (Should Stay Pending)
```powershell
# After rejection, status should be 'pending', not 'cancelled'
$headers = @{"Authorization" = "Bearer $adminToken"}
$body = @{action="reject"; rejectionReason="Invalid proof"} | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/v1/admin/registrations/$regId/verify" -Method Put -Headers $headers -ContentType "application/json" -Body $body
```
