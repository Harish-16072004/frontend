# ✅ QR Code Upload Fixed - Correct Folder Name!

## 🐛 The Problem:

**QR codes were not appearing in the S3 folder you were checking!**

### Why:
- S3 folder in AWS Console: `participant-qr-code/` ✅
- Code was uploading to: `qrcodes/` ❌
- **Mismatch!** Files were going to the wrong folder

---

## 🔧 Solution Applied:

### **Changed folder name in code to match S3:**

#### 1. Updated `qrGenerator.js`
```javascript
// Before:
uploadBufferToS3(qrBuffer, `${participantId}.png`, 'image/png', 'qrcodes')

// After:
uploadBufferToS3(qrBuffer, `${participantId}.png`, 'image/png', 'participant-qr-code')
```

#### 2. Updated `s3Upload.js`
```javascript
// Before:
exports.uploadBufferToS3 = async (..., folder = 'qrcodes') => {

// After:
exports.uploadBufferToS3 = async (..., folder = 'participant-qr-code') => {
```

#### 3. Updated test script
```javascript
// Before:
const key = `qrcodes/test-${timestamp}-TEST001.png`;

// After:
const key = `participant-qr-code/test-${timestamp}-TEST001.png`;
```

## 🔍 How to Check QR Codes in S3:

### **AWS Console:**
1. Go to S3 → Buckets → `shackles-25-26`
2. Click on `participant-qr-code/` folder
3. You'll see all QR codes! ✅

### **Current Files:**
- ✅ 2 test QR codes already uploaded
- ✅ Ready for real participant QR codes
- ✅ Folder is working correctly

---

## 📊 System Status:

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Folder Name** | ✅ Fixed | Changed `qrcodes/` → `participant-qr-code/` |
| **S3 Upload** | ✅ Working | Test files successfully uploaded |
| **Backend Server** | ✅ Running | Port 5000 with updated code |
| **MongoDB** | ✅ Connected | Database ready |
| **Test QR Codes** | ✅ Uploaded | 2 files in participant-qr-code folder |

---

## 🚀 Next Steps:

### **1. Verify Payment to Test Real Upload:**

1. Login as admin
2. Verify a pending payment
3. System will:
   - Generate participant ID (e.g., SHEN003)
   - Create QR code
   - Upload to: `participant-qr-code/[timestamp]-SHEN003.png`
   - You'll see it in AWS S3 Console!

### **2. Check S3 Console:**
- Refresh the `participant-qr-code/` folder
- You'll see the new QR code file
- Click to view/download

### **3. Check MongoDB:**
```javascript
{
  participantId: "SHEN003",
  qrCode: "https://shackles-25-26.s3.../participant-qr-code/...-SHEN003.png",
  qrCodeKey: "participant-qr-code/...-SHEN003.png"
}
```

## 📝 Files Modified:

1. ✅ `backend/src/utils/qrGenerator.js`
   - Line 127: Changed folder from `'qrcodes'` → `'participant-qr-code'`

2. ✅ `backend/src/utils/s3Upload.js`
   - Line 247: Changed default folder from `'qrcodes'` → `'participant-qr-code'`

3. ✅ `backend/test-s3-upload.js`
   - Updated test to use `'participant-qr-code'` folder

---

## 💡 Why This Happened:

### **Common Scenario:**

1. S3 bucket created with folder: `participant-qr-code/`
2. Code initially written with folder: `qrcodes/`
3. **Mismatch!** Files went to different folder
4. You checked `participant-qr-code/` → empty ❌
5. Files were actually in `qrcodes/` → but you didn't check there

### **Solution:**
- Standardized on `participant-qr-code/` to match S3 structure
- Updated all code to use consistent folder name
- Now everything goes to the right place! ✅

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist:

- [x] Test QR code uploaded successfully
- [x] Files visible in `participant-qr-code/` folder
- [x] Public URLs are accessible
- [x] Backend server running with updated code
- [x] MongoDB connected
- [x] Ready for real payment verification

---

## 🎉 SUMMARY:

### **Problem:**
- QR codes uploading to wrong folder (`qrcodes/`)
- You were checking correct folder (`participant-qr-code/`)
- Folder names didn't match → files "missing"

### **Solution:**
- Changed code to use `participant-qr-code/`
- Matches your S3 bucket structure
- Test upload successful
- 2 test files now in correct folder

### **Result:**
✅ QR codes now upload to `participant-qr-code/` folder  
✅ Visible in AWS S3 Console  
✅ Public URLs work correctly  
✅ System fully operational
