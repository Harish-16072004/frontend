# Non-Technical Events - 4th Event Added âœ…

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Event Count
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/Events/NonTechnical.jsx`

**Changed**:
- Line 143: Subtitle updated from **"3 Fun-Filled Events"** â†’ **"4 Fun-Filled Events"**

### 2. Added 4th Event Placeholder
**Event ID**: 4
**Name**: "New Non-Technical Event"
**Status**: Placeholder - Ready for your details

```javascript
{
  id: 4,
  name: 'New Non-Technical Event',
  symbol: 'â—‹',
  description: 'Exciting new event coming soon! Details to be announced.',
  rules: [
    'Event details coming soon',
    'Check back for updates',
    'Registration will open soon',
  ],
  coordinator: {
    name: 'Event Team',
    phone: '+91 9384583077',
  },
  prizes: 'To be announced',
}
```

### 3. Registration System Already Integrated
âœ… The 4th event automatically has:
- "Register Now" button
- Authentication checks
- Registration tracking
- Database integration
- All the same functionality as other events

## Current Non-Technical Events

| ID | Event Name | Status |
|----|------------|--------|
| 1 | IPL Auction | âœ… Complete |
| 2 | Kollywood Quiz | âœ… Complete |
| 3 | Red Light Green Light | âœ… Complete |
| 4 | New Non-Technical Event | ðŸ”„ Placeholder |

## Next Steps: Add Your Event Details

Replace the placeholder in `NonTechnical.jsx` with your actual event details:

```javascript
{
  id: 4,
  name: 'YOUR EVENT NAME',  // e.g., 'Treasure Hunt', 'Musical Chairs', etc.
  symbol: 'â—‹',
  description: 'YOUR EVENT DESCRIPTION',
  rules: [
    'Rule 1',
    'Rule 2',
    'Rule 3',
    // Add more rules
  ],
  coordinator: {
    name: 'COORDINATOR NAME',
    phone: 'PHONE NUMBER',
  },
  prizes: '1st: â‚¹X | 2nd: â‚¹Y | 3rd: â‚¹Z',  // Optional
}
```

## Example: If Adding "Treasure Hunt"

```javascript
{
  id: 4,
  name: 'Treasure Hunt',
  symbol: 'â—‹',
  description: 'Navigate through clues and challenges to find the hidden treasure!',
  rules: [
    'Team size: 3-4 members',
    'Follow clues to different locations',
    'Solve puzzles at each checkpoint',
    'First team to find treasure wins',
    'Duration: 2 hours',
  ],
  coordinator: {
    name: 'Rajesh',
    phone: '+91 9876543210',
  },
  prizes: '1st: â‚¹5000 | 2nd: â‚¹3000 | 3rd: â‚¹2000',
}
```

## What's Already Working

âœ… **Registration Button** - Already functional for event #4
âœ… **Database Integration** - Will store registrations automatically
âœ… **Authentication** - Checks if user is logged in
âœ… **Duplicate Prevention** - Can't register twice
âœ… **Status Display** - Shows "âœ“ Registered" when done

## Testing

1. Frontend should show 4 events now
2. Event #4 shows as "New Non-Technical Event"
3. "Register Now" button works on event #4
4. Just replace the placeholder details when ready!

## Status

âœ… **Subtitle Updated**: "3" â†’ "4 Fun-Filled Events"
âœ… **4th Event Added**: Placeholder with registration functionality
âœ… **System Ready**: Just add your event details!

**Note**: The 4th event currently shows as a placeholder. Simply update the event object with the actual event name, description, rules, coordinator, and prizes when you're ready!
